For high energy physics, we have focused on implementing learnable linear and non-linear symmetries into model architectures for enhanced model performance and interpretability. Astrophysics interests include novel ways of analyzing exoplanet system parameters through their spectra, including more efficient deep learning approaches to forward and retrieval models. I have also incorporated quantum information science into my research by solving NP-Hard problems with Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) algorithms.",

Rev. Lett. 82, 133 (1999)]. To understand this mode's role in the FFL, I developed a Green's function approach to include the gapped term in the zero-temperature vertex in order to see how this mode affects the Cooper instability and the superconducting transition temperature, T_C.",
