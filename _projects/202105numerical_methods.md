title: Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing
description: This material was produced during a Spring 2021 Course at Boston College entitled Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing taught by Physics Professor Jan Engelbrecht. This was done with a Linux operating system in the XQuartz terminal using C++ and Gnuplot. Image - The evolution (top left) of the damped driven non linear pendulum for the chaotic case. The 3D limit cycle (top right) is also shown, as well as, two different poincare sections (bottom, 2D horizontal slices of the 3D limit cycle).
