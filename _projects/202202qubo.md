title: Quantum Computing
description: Here, you can find many Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) Problems used as a semi-classical introduction to quantum computing algorithms. Using CPLEX and DOCPLEX, two quantum computing API's, I solve many unique problems using QUBO models, which are Ising spin models intended to find novel ways to find solutions to NP-Hard problems. Problems include the knapsack, graph partitioning, clustering, and stable marriage problems, as well as, games such as Conway's The Game of Life.
